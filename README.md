## Instructions

1. Google Data Studio account
   - Log into your Google Data Studio account or [create a free account](https://datastudio.google.com).
2. Select a report
   - Click on a link to one of the reports above that you would like to use.
3. Copy the report
   - Move your mouse cursor to the top edge of the report window. The top navigation bar will appear.
   - On the right-hand side, you will see an icon with two rectangles, one on top of another. Click on it to make a copy of the report.
   - In the pop-up window, select a new Data Source. You can use ‘Sample Google Analytics Data’ if you would like to just play with the report or click on a drop-down field below the heading  ‘New Data Source’. Then, click the ‘Create New Data Source’ button at the bottom if you would like to use data from one of the sites that you manage. In the search box, type ‘Google Analytics’ and select it. Then, press the ‘Authorize’ button, and ‘Allow’ on the page that appears. Now select a Google Analytics account, then a property, and finally a view of the website for which you would like to use this report. Next, click the ‘Connect’ button in the top-right corner. Then, select the ‘Add to Report’ button in the top-right corner. Press the ‘Copy report’ button. You can find more information about this step in the [Google Analytics data source tutorial](https://support.google.com/datastudio/answer/6295036?hl=en) at the Google Help Center.
   - Give it an appropriate name like ‘Website Performance Report for Company X - March 2019’ by clicking on the text ‘Website Performance Report…’ in the top-right corner.
4. Edit the report
   - If you are not in ‘Edit mode’, move your mouse cursor to the top edge of the report window. The top navigation bar will appear. Then, click the grey button that says ‘Edit’. Now you can change anything in this report.
   - Go to ‘File’ (top navigation bar), select ‘Report Settings’, and select the date range for which you would like to show the data (to do this, you need to first select the report-level data source). Once done, it will be updated on all pages.
   - Remove the ‘Company's Logo’ placeholder. Once removed, it should automatically disappear from all pages. Then, add your company's or client's logo by going to ‘Insert’ (top navigation bar), and then selecting ‘Image’. Upload the logo, resize it and place it in the top-left corner. Right-click on it and select ‘Make report-level’. The logo will appear on all pages in this report.
   - Replace ‘YourCompanyName’ in the footer with your company name.
   - Update the text field in the top-right corner so that it reflects the month and year from which the data was pulled.
   - Update information on the 'Summary' page.
   - If the report includes the ‘Blog’ page, you need to make the following changes: 1) In the section ‘Session by Authors,’ you need to edit the table and change the dimension ‘Brands’ to ‘Authors’, 2) In the section ‘Session by Content Categories,’ you need to edit the table and change the dimension ‘Product Categories’ to ‘Post Categories’ and 3) Select ‘Resources’ in the top navigation bar, and then choose ‘Manage Filters’. You will need to edit ‘Blog Pages’ and ‘Blog as a Starting Point’ filters by clicking the ‘EDIT’ buttons. Replace ‘/google+’ with the name of the directory that the blog posts contain in the URL. For example, if you post a URL that looks like www.example.com/blog/post-name/, enter in the field ‘/blog/’; if it looks like www.example.com/insights/post-name/, enter in the field ‘/insights/’.
5. Optional improvements
   - Make page names in the top navigation bar clickable by adding links to them.
   - Make titles of pages on a website clickable by creating a calculated field like HYPERLINK(CONCAT(“//mydomain.com”, Page), Page Title).
   - Add any branding that you want (for example, your company logo, contact details, change the theme colours, etc.).
   - Add a Google Analytics tracking code to the report by creating a new Google Analytics account or just a property. Then copy the tracking ID into your Google Data Studio report, under ‘File’ (top navigation bar) > ‘Report Settings’ > ‘Google Analytics Tracking ID’ section. It allows you to analyse how your client uses the report to make it even better.
6. Check each page
   - Glance through each page to make sure you are happy with everything. For some sites, a few charts might not show data. Report an issue on GitHub, and I will try to help you out.
7. Share the report
   - To share a link to the report with your client or your team, click on an icon of a person with the plus sign beside it in the top right-hand corner. Enter an email of a person that you would like to send an invitation to see this report. In the drop-down field on the right-hand side, select whether you would like to give that person an editor only viewer permission.
   - To save the report as a PDF and send a static version of it to the customer, go to ‘File’ (top navigation bar), select ‘Download as’ and select ‘PDF’.
8. Navigate the report
   - To navigate the report, use the ‘right’ and ‘left’ arrows on your keyboard to see the next and previous page, respectively.
9. Using the report
   - In the 'View' mode, you can drill down into data shown in some charts, by right-clicking on it and selecting a 'Drill down' option. You can also drill down into a value specific value in charts, for example, traffic by hour on specific data of the week. To do it, select a value in a chart you would like to investigate in the chart, then by right-clicking on it and selecting a 'Drill down' option.

## Google Data Studio Bugs

Here is a list of bugs discovered when creating this report template. Hopefully, the Google Data team is going to fix them in the nearest future.

- When you are selecting a custom colour for an item, the current colour always has an additional ‘ff’ attached at the end of the Hex Code.
- On laptops, reports with a title over 95 characters start to push the ‘Edit’ button off the screen making it invisible for users. It would be great to have a small icon appear in the bottom-right corner of the header allowing users to show the end of the header by moving all items to the left when UI elements (for example, icons and buttons) are pushed off the screen.
- When you sort data in ascending order by the ‘Day of week’ dimension from Google Ads, days are listed alphabetically, that is, Friday, Monday, Saturday, Sunday, Thursday, Tuesday, Wednesday, instead of their order, for example, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc., or Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, etc.
- Google Ads - 'Total conv. value' and 'Value / conv.' metrics have the type set to 'Numeric' instead of 'Currency', which doesn't display the currency symbol next to the value.

## Google Data Studio Feature Requests

Here is a list of features that would make creating and managing reports in Google Data Studio much easier. Hopefully, the Google Data team is going to implement them in the nearest future.

- URLs - An ability to use relative links to pages in the report so that when you copy a report, links don't point to the original report, for example, /page/FChm/.
- Chart headers - Editing the header text in tables, metrics name and comparison label in scorecards to make them more descriptive or shorter.
- Date comparison - Adding multiple comparison dates in scorecards, tables, charts, etc., for example, previous period, previous period last year and previous period two year ago.
- Date comparison - Time series charts automatically aligning lines with data for the current period and previous period by day of the week. For example, values for the Monday, the 1st of April and Monday, the 4th of March are in the same place on the x-axes. The same for the Tuesday, the 2nd of April and Tuesday, the 5th of March, etc.
- Theme colours - Setting theme variable colours, which can be used as the default colour by all tables, charts and graphs. The ideal solution would allow users to adjust the colours used by all tables, charts and graphs on all pages with a few clicks.
- Grouping data - A way to show sessions by major browser versions, using dimensions or calculated fields, for example, Chrome 72.0 instead of 72.0.3626.109, 72.0.3626.96, 72.0.3626.119, etc. Also, there always seems to be a zero after the first full stop.
- Google Analytics integration - Taking the domain name from a Google Analytics property so that it can be used in calculated fields with hyperlinks and it does not need to be manually specified when the report is used to analyse a new website's traffic.
- Charts - Having a ‘positive change colour’ and ‘negative change colour’ switched colours by default for the bounce rate and all page load. An increase in bounce rate represents a negative change and it should be shown by default in red, while a decrease is positive and should be in green.
- Charts - Renaming the ‘positive change colour’ and ‘negative change colour’ titles to ‘increased value color’ and ‘decreased value colour’, as it's not always accurate. For example, increase in bounce rate or page load is not something positive for a website.
- Connectors - Official Google My Business connector for Google Data Studio by Google. The current community connections are often paid and not straight forward to set up as official Google Analytics or Google Ads integrations.
- Hidden pages - In addition to an icon indicating that the page is hidden in the page control, it would be great to see a reminder in the Edit mode too. Some people usually use primarily the 'left' and the 'right' keyboard key to move between pages. This way they won't see a reminder that the page is hidden and publish the new version of the report without making it visible. Perhaps, a grey bar below the 'Toolbar' in the Edit mode saying "This page is hidden from the View mode" could be not over distracting solution.
- Tables - Specifying the width of left and right padding for a table. The default width of the padding is a bit too small when you assign the table a different colour than the background colour.
